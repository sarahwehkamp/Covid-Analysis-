# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Death Analysis Dashboard

This project is a dashboard built in **Tableau** that analyzes COVID-19 death statistics globally. It provides a comprehensive view of how the pandemic has impacted countries and continents through key visualizations and metrics.

## 📂 What's Included in This Repository

This project repository contains all the files used to build and support the **COVID-19 Global Death Analysis Dashboard**:

- 🧾 **SQL Queries** – All SQL scripts used for data exploration, transformation, and analysis  
- 📊 **Excel Files** – Datasets used in Tableau  
- 📈 **Tableau Dashboard Link** – Final visualization showcasing key insights  
- 📁 **README File** – Project overview, goals, insights, and author info  

You can explore the code, data, and dashboard setup to understand the process behind the analysis and replicate or build upon it.

## 📌 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to:

- 🌍 Showcase **global COVID-19 statistics**
- 📈 Analyze **Percent Population Infected per Country**
- 🧮 Display **Total Deaths per Continent**
- 👥 Reveal **Infection Rate vs. Population**

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- 🗃️ **SQL** – for querying and preparing the data  
- 📊 **Excel** – for cleaning and organizing the dataset  
- 📈 **Tableau** – for building the interactive visualizations

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from **Our World in Data**:  
🔗 [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/data?q=covid+19)

This open dataset includes daily updates on COVID-19 cases, deaths, testing, and population data by country.

Here are some key insights from the dashboard:

- 🇺🇸 **United States** has one of the highest total death counts globally, with millions infected and a significant percentage of the population affected.
- 🌍 **Europe** recorded the highest number of deaths per continent during peak pandemic phases.
- 🇮🇳 **India** shows a relatively high infection count but lower deaths per capita due to its large population base.
- 🌍 Several **African countries** had lower reported death numbers, which may reflect testing/reporting limitations rather than actual impact.
- 📊 The **infection rate per country** shows stark contrasts—some nations experienced infection rates well above 15% of their population, while others remained below 1%.

These insights help paint a picture of the varied impact of COVID-19 based on geography, population size, and infection rates.
